python-math-captch

We have designed a simple math based captcha using GUI in python. The permission will be granted to move to next page of the application only if user is authenticated based on math captcha. The math captcha will show in different forms like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A pop up menu will be shown to demonstrate how many times left. Maximum 5 attempts will be given to user.
The permission should be granted to move to next page of the application only if user is authenticated based on math captcha.
